# Emotion Detection using CNN and OpenCV

This project implements an Emotion Detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV. It allows real-time detection and recognition of human emotions in images or video streams.

## Features
- Detect and classify emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness, and surprise.
- Utilizes a trained CNN model for accurate emotion recognition.
- Real-time emotion detection from live camera feed or recorded video.
- Integrated with OpenCV for face detection and image preprocessing.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV

## Getting Started
1. Install the required dependencies mentioned above.
2. Clone or download the project repository.
3. Run the `main.py` script to start the emotion detection system.
4. Ensure the camera is connected and accessible for live emotion detection.

## Usage
- Press 'q' to exit the emotion detection system.
- Emotions will be displayed in real-time on the video feed.
